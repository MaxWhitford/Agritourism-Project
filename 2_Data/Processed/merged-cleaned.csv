"Idaho","§ 6-3001. Short title
This act shall be known as the “Idaho Agritourism Promotion Act.”
§ 6-3002. Purpose
The legislature finds that agriculture plays a substantial role in the economy, culture
and history of Idaho. As an increasing number of Idahoans are removed from day-to-
day agricultural experiences, agritourism provides a valuable opportunity for the
general public to interact with, experience and understand agriculture. Inherent risks
exist on farms and ranches, the elimination of which would diminish the agritourism
experience. Uncertainty of potential liability associated with inherent risks has a
negative impact on the establishment and success of agritourism operations.
§ 6-3003. Definitions
As used in this chapter, the term:
(1) “Agritourism activity” means any activity carried out on a farm or ranch that allows
members of the general public, for recreational, entertainment or educational
purposes, to view or enjoy rural activities including, but not limited to, farming,
ranching, historic, cultural, on-site educational programs, recreational farming
programs that may include on-site hospitality services, guided and self-guided tours,
bed and breakfast accommodations, petting zoos, farm festivals, corn mazes, harvest-
your-own operations, hayrides, barn parties, horseback riding, fee fishing and
camping. An activity is an agritourism activity whether or not the participant paid to
participate in the activity.
(2) “Agritourism professional” means any person who is engaged in the business of
providing one (1) or more agritourism activities, whether or not for compensation.
(3) “Inherent risks of agritourism activity” means those dangers or conditions that
are an integral part of an agritourism activity including certain hazards, including
surface and subsurface conditions, natural conditions of land, vegetation,
The National Agricultural Law Center NationalAgLawCenter.org | nataglaw@uark.edu
waters, the behavior of wild or domestic animals and ordinary dangers of structures or
equipment ordinarily used in farming and ranching operations. Inherent risks of
agritourism activity also include the potential of a participant to act in a negligent
manner that may contribute to injury to the participant or others, including failing to
follow instructions given by the agritourism professional or failing to exercise
reasonable caution while engaging in the agritourism activity.
(4) “Participant” means any person, other than the agritourism professional, who
engages in an agritourism activity.
(5) “Person” means an individual, fiduciary, firm, association, partnership, limited
liability company, corporation, unit of government or any other group acting as a unit.
§ 6-3004. Liability
(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, an agritourism professional is
not liable for injury to or death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of
agritourism activities, so long as the warning contained in section 6-3005, Idaho Code,
is posted as required and, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no
participant or participant's representative can maintain an action against or recover
from an agritourism professional for injury, loss, damage or death of the participant
resulting from any of the inherent risks of agritourism activities. In any action for
damages against an agritourism professional for agritourism activities, the
agritourism professional must plead the affirmative defense of assumption of the risk
of agritourism activity by the participant.
(2) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section prevents or limits the liability of an
agritourism professional if the agritourism professional does any one (1) or more of the
following:
(a) Commits an act or omission that constitutes negligence or willful or wanton
disregard for the safety of the participant, and that act or omission proximately
causes injury, damage or death to the participant;
(b) Has actual knowledge or reasonably should have known of a dangerous condition
on the land, facilities or equipment used in the activity or the dangerous propensity
of a particular animal used in such activity and does not make the danger known to
the participant, and the danger proximately causes injury, damage or death to the
participant.
(3) Any limitation on legal liability afforded by this section to an agritourism
professional is in addition to any other limitations of legal liability otherwise provided
by law.
The National Agricultural Law Center NationalAgLawCenter.org | nataglaw@uark.edu

provided in this section shall prevent an agritourism professional from invoking the
privileges of immunity provided by the provisions of this chapter.
§ 6-3006. Taxation status

acts for which agritourism is liable for loss, damage, or injury.
The Commissioner of Agriculture is hereby authorized to, and shall devise means of,
advancing agritourism in the state, and in the performance of such duty, he or she shall
have the authority to call upon any department, division, or officer of the state or

3. The ordinary dangers of structures or equipment ordinarily used where agricultural,
horticultural, or silvicultural crops are grown or farm animals or farmed fish are raised.
4. The possibility that a participant in an agricultural tourism activity may act in a
negligent manner, including by failing to follow instructions given by the
agricultural tourism operator or by failing to exercise reasonable caution while

engaging in the agricultural tourism activity, that may contribute to the injury to that
participant or to another participant.
(2) Immunity from liability. (a) Subject to par. (b), an agricultural tourism provider is
immune from civil liability for injury to or the death of an individual who is
participating in an agricultural tourism activity on property owned, leased, or managed
by the agricultural tourism provider if all of the following apply:
1. The participant is injured or killed as a result of a risk inherent in an agricultural
tourism activity.
2. The agricultural tourism provider posts and maintains, in a clearly visible location at
each entrance to the property where the agricultural tourism activity takes place or at
the location of each agricultural tourism activity, a sign that contains the following
notice in black lettering, each letter a minimum of one inch in height, on a white
background: “Notice: A person who observes or participates in an agricultural tourism
activity on this property assumes the risks inherent in the agricultural tourism activity.

(3) Appreciation of risk. A participant in a recreational activity engaged in on premises
owned or leased by a person who offers facilities to the general public for participation
in recreational activities accepts the risks inherent in the recreational activity of which
the ordinary prudent person is or should be aware. In a negligence action for recovery
of damages for death, personal injury or property damage, conduct by a participant who
accepts the risks under this subsection is contributory negligence, to which the
comparative negligence provisions of s. 895.045 shall apply.
