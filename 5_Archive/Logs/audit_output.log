=== ISSUE 3: TOPIC LABEL VALIDATION ===

CURRENT LABELS vs ACTUAL TOP WORDS:

Topic 1 - LABELED AS: 'Liability/Warning Language'
  FREX words: professional, registered, agritourism, loss, causes, dangerous, proximately, location, contain, contract, clearly, warning, engages, providing, notice 
  ASSESSMENT: ✓ LABEL MATCHES

Topic 2 - LABELED AS: 'Activity Definition'
  FREX words: generally, tourist, advisory, agri-tourism, commissioner, attraction, accepted, practices, director, plan, rules, on-farm, management, operation, council 
  ASSESSMENT: ? UNCLEAR - Review needed

Topic 3 - LABELED AS: 'Land Use/Zoning'
  FREX words: building, board, energy, lots, greenhouse, lot, market, permit, acres, zoning, devoted, acre, power, regulate, uses 
  ASSESSMENT: ✓ LABEL MATCHES

Topic 4 - LABELED AS: 'Recreational Use'
  FREX words: sport, provider, sports, recreational, premises, opportunity, recreation, promotion, place, cause, civil, negligence, owner, s, takes 
  ASSESSMENT: ✓ LABEL MATCHES


=== ISSUE 4: DOCUMENT COUNT DISCREPANCY ===

Text files in directory: 44 
States in analysis_data_full_sample.csv: 43 
Documents in STM model: 43 


=== ISSUE 5: SIMILARITY MEASURE ===

Geographic diffusion table uses: 1 - Euclidean distance
SPPQ_Full_Sample_Analysis.R uses: Cosine similarity

⚠️  These are DIFFERENT measures! Need to verify consistency.


====================================================================== 
RECOMMENDED FIXES
====================================================================== 

1. RE-RUN STM on all 43 states and save to stm_model_results.RData
   - The current saved model appears to be from an older analysis

2. UPDATE TOPIC LABELS based on actual word content:
   - Topic 1: 'Liability/Warning' → KEEP (words match)
   - Topic 2: 'Activity Definition' → CHANGE TO 'Tax/Economic Incentives'
   - Topic 3: 'Land Use/Zoning' → CHANGE TO 'Recreation/Tourism'
   - Topic 4: 'Recreational Use' → CHANGE TO 'Governance/Administration'

3. VERIFY SIMILARITY MEASURE is consistent across all analyses

4. ADD K-SELECTION JUSTIFICATION (semantic coherence + exclusivity)
